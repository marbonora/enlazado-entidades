BACKGROUND : Ultrasonound used identify anatomical structures regional anaesthesia guide needle insertion injection local anaesthetic . ScanNav Anatomy Peripheral Nerve Block ( Intelligent Ultrasound , Cardiff , UK ) artificial intelligence-based device produces colour overlay real-time B-mode ultrasound highlight anatomical structures interest . evaluated accuracy artificial-intelligence colour overlay perceived influence risk adverse events block failure.METHODS : Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia experts acquired 720 videos 40 volunteers ( across nine anatomical regions ) without using device . artificial-intelligence colour overlay subsequently applied . Three experts independently reviewed video ( original unmodified video ) assess accuracy colour overlay relation key anatomical structures ( true positive/negative false positive/negative ) potential highlighting modify perceived risk adverse events ( needle trauma nerves , arteries , pleura , peritoneum ) block failure.RESULTS : artificial-intelligence models identified structure interest 93.5 % cases ( 1519/1624 ) , false-negative rate 3.0 % ( 48/1624 ) false-positive rate 3.5 % ( 57/1624 ) .

Cerebrospinal fluid mutant huntingtin biomarker huntingtin lowering striatum Huntington disease mice Huntington disease ( HD ) neurodegenerative disease caused trinucleotide repeat expansion HTT gene encoding elongated polyglutamine tract huntingtin ( HTT ) protein . Expanded mutant HTT ( mHTT ) toxic leads regional atrophy neuronal cell loss brain , occurs earliest striatum . Therapeutic lowering mHTT central nervous system ( CNS ) shown promise preclinical studies , multiple approaches currently clinical development HD . Quantitation mHTT cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) used clinical pharmacodynamic biomarker target engagement CNS . previously shown CNS major source mHTT CSF . However , little known specific brain regions cell types contribute CSF mHTT . Therefore , better understanding origins CSF mHTT whether therapies targeting mHTT striatum would expected associated significant lowering mHTT CSF needed . , use complementary pharmacological genetic-based approaches either restrict expression mHTT striatum selectively deplete mHTT striatum evaluate contribution brain region mHTT CSF . show viral expression mHTT fragment restricted striatum leads detectable mHTT CSF . demonstrate targeted lowering mHTT selectively striatum using antisense oligonucleotide leads significant reduction mHTT CSF HD mice . Furthermore , using transgenic mouse model HD expresses full length human mHTT wild type HTT , show genetic inactivation mHTT selectively striatum results significant reduction mHTT CSF . Taken together , data supports conclusion striatum contributes sufficiently pool mHTT CSF therapeutic levels mHTT lowering striatum detected measure HD mice . suggests CSF mHTT may represent pharmacodynamic biomarker therapies lower mHTT striatum . 2022.0 huntington disease biomarker neurodegeneration huntingtin cerebrospinal fluid antisense oligonucleotide Caron , NS Banos , R Aly , AE Xie , YY Ko , Potluri , N Anderson , C Black , HF Anderson , LM Gordon , B Hayden , MR","Southwell, Amber L.","Luchsinger , JA Nutritional metabolism cerebral bioenergetics Alzheimer 's disease related dementias Disturbances brain 's capacity meet energy demand increase risk synaptic loss , neurodegeneration , cognitive decline .
