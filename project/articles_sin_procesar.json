            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultrasonound is used to identify anatomical structures during regional anaesthesia and to guide needle insertion and injection of local anaesthetic. ScanNav Anatomy Peripheral Nerve Block (Intelligent Ultrasound, Cardiff, UK) is an artificial intelligence-based device that produces a colour overlay on real-time B-mode ultrasound to highlight anatomical structures of interest. We evaluated the accuracy of the artificial-intelligence colour overlay and its perceived influence on risk of adverse events or block failure.METHODS: Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia experts acquired 720 videos from 40 volunteers (across nine anatomical regions) without using the device. The artificial-intelligence colour overlay was subsequently applied. Three more experts independently reviewed each video (with the original unmodified video) to assess accuracy of the colour overlay in relation to key anatomical structures (true positive/negative and false positive/negative) and the potential for highlighting to modify perceived risk of adverse events (needle trauma to nerves, arteries, pleura, and peritoneum) or block failure.RESULTS: The artificial-intelligence models identified the structure of interest in 93.5% of cases (1519/1624), with a false-negative rate of 3.0% (48/1624) and a false-positive rate of 3.5% (57/1624). Highlighting was judged to reduce the risk of unwanted needle trauma to nerves, arteries, pleura, and peritoneum in 62.9-86.4% of cases (302/480 to 345/400), and to increase the risk in 0.0-1.7% (0/160 to 8/480). Risk of block failure was reported to be reduced in 81.3% of scans (585/720) and to be increased in 1.8% (13/720).CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence-based devices can potentially aid image acquisition and interpretation in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate their effectiveness in supporting training and clinical practice.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04906018.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia relies on the visualisation of key landmark, target, and safety structures on ultrasound. However, this can be challenging, particularly for inexperienced practitioners. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied to medical image interpretation, including ultrasound. In this exploratory study, we evaluated ultrasound scanning performance by non-experts in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia, with and without the use of an assistive AI device.METHODS: Twenty-one anaesthetists, all non-experts in ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia, underwent a standardised teaching session in ultrasound scanning for six peripheral nerve blocks. All then performed a scan for each block; half of the scans were performed with AI assistance and half without. Experts assessed acquisition of the correct block view and correct identification of sono-anatomical structures on each view. Participants reported scan confidence, experts provided a global rating score of scan performance, and scans were timed.RESULTS: Experts assessed 126 ultrasound scans. Participants acquired the correct block view in 56/62 (90.3%) scans with the device compared with 47/62 (75.1%) without (P=0.031, two data points lost). Correct identification of sono-anatomical structures on the view was 188/212 (88.8%) with the device compared with 161/208 (77.4%) without (P=0.002). There was no significant overall difference in participant confidence, expert global performance score, or scan time.CONCLUSIONS: Use of an assistive AI device was associated with improved ultrasound image acquisition and interpretation. Such technology holds potential to augment performance of ultrasound scanning for regional anaesthesia by non-experts, potentially expanding patient access to these techniques.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05156099.",

            "abstract": "The identification of molecular biomarkers in CSF from individuals affected by Huntington disease may help improve predictions of disease onset, better define disease progression and could facilitate the evaluation of potential therapies. The primary objective of our study was to investigate novel CSF protein candidates and replicate previously reported protein biomarker changes in CSF from Huntington disease mutation carriers and healthy controls. Our secondary objective was to compare the discriminatory potential of individual protein analytes and combinations of CSF protein markers for stratifying individuals based on the severity of Huntington disease. We conducted a hypothesis-driven analysis of 26 pre-specified protein analytes in CSF from 16 manifest Huntington disease subjects, eight premanifest Huntington disease mutation carriers and eight healthy control individuals using parallel-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. In addition to reproducing reported changes in previously investigated CSF biomarkers (NEFL, PDYN, and PENK), we also identified novel exploratory CSF proteins (C1QB, CNR1, GNAL, IDO1, IGF2, and PPP1R1B) whose levels were altered in Huntington disease mutation carriers and/or across stages of disease. Moreover, we report strong associations of select CSF proteins with clinical measures of disease severity in manifest Huntington disease subjects (C1QB, CNR1, NEFL, PDYN, PPP1R1B, and TTR) and with years to predicted disease onset in premanifest Huntington disease mutation carriers (ALB, C4B, CTSD, IGHG1, and TTR). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, we identified PENK as being the most discriminant CSF protein for stratifying Huntington disease mutation carriers from controls. We also identified exploratory multi-marker CSF protein panels that improved discrimination of premanifest Huntington disease mutation carriers from controls (PENK, ALB and NEFL), early/midstage Huntington disease from premanifest mutation carriers (PPP1R1B, TTR, CHI3L1, and CTSD), and late-stage from early/midstage Huntington disease (CNR1, PPP1R1B, BDNF, APOE, and IGHG1) compared with individual CSF proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that combinations of CSF proteins can outperform individual markers for stratifying individuals based on Huntington disease mutation status and disease severity. Moreover, we define exploratory multi-marker CSF protein panels that, if validated, may be used to improve the accuracy of disease-onset predictions, complement existing clinical and imaging biomarkers for monitoring the severity of Huntington disease, and potentially for assessing therapeutic response in clinical trials. Additional studies with CSF collected from larger cohorts of Huntington disease mutation carriers are needed to replicate these exploratory findings.",

            "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene encoding an elongated polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. Expanded mutant HTT (mHTT) is toxic and leads to regional atrophy and neuronal cell loss in the brain, which occurs earliest in the striatum. Therapeutic lowering of mHTT in the central nervous system (CNS) has shown promise in preclinical studies, with multiple approaches currently in clinical development for HD. Quantitation of mHTT in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is being used as a clinical pharmacodynamic biomarker of target engagement in the CNS. We have previously shown that the CNS is a major source of mHTT in the CSF. However, little is known about the specific brain regions and cell types that contribute to CSF mHTT. Therefore, a better understanding of the origins of CSF mHTT and whether therapies targeting mHTT in the striatum would be expected to be associated with significant lowering of mHTT in the CSF is needed. Here, we use complementary pharmacological and genetic-based approaches to either restrict expression of mHTT to the striatum or selectively deplete mHTT in the striatum to evaluate the contribution of this brain region to mHTT in the CSF. We show that viral expression of a mHTT fragment restricted to the striatum leads to detectable mHTT in the CSF. We demonstrate that targeted lowering of mHTT selectively in the striatum using an antisense oligonucleotide leads to a significant reduction of mHTT in the CSF of HD mice. Furthermore, using a transgenic mouse model of HD that expresses full length human mHTT and wild type HTT, we show that genetic inactivation of mHTT selectively in the striatum results in a significant reduction of mHTT in the CSF. Taken together, our data supports the conclusion that the striatum contributes sufficiently to the pool of mHTT in the CSF that therapeutic levels of mHTT lowering in the striatum can be detected by this measure in HD mice.

            "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Therapeutics that lower HTT have shown preclinical promise and are being evaluated in clinical trials. However, clinical assessment of brain HTT lowering presents challenges. We have reported that mutant HTT (mHTT) in the CSF of HD patients correlates with clinical measures, including disease burden as well as motor and cognitive performance. We have also shown that lowering HTT in the brains of HD mice results in correlative reduction of mHTT in the CSF, prompting the use of this measure as an exploratory marker of target engagement in clinical trials. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms of mHTT clearance from the brain in adult mice of both sexes to elucidate the significance of therapy-induced CSF mHTT changes. We demonstrate that, although neurodegeneration increases CSF mHTT concentrations, mHTT is also present in the CSF of mice in the absence of neurodegeneration. Importantly, we show that secretion of mHTT from cells in the CNS followed by glymphatic clearance from the extracellular space contributes to mHTT in the CSF. Furthermore, we observe secretion of wild type HTT from healthy control neurons, suggesting that HTT secretion is a normal process occurring in the absence of pathogenesis. Overall, our data support both passive release and active clearance of mHTT into CSF, suggesting that its treatment-induced changes may represent a combination of target engagement and preservation of neurons.",

            "abstract": "Disturbances in the brain's capacity to meet its energy demand increase the risk of synaptic loss, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Nutritional and metabolic interventions that target metabolic pathways combined with diagnostics to identify deficits in cerebral bioenergetics may therefore offer novel therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention and management. Many diet-derived natural bioactive components can govern cellular energy metabolism but their effects on brain aging are not clear. This review examines how nutritional metabolism can regulate brain bioenergetics and mitigate AD risk. We focus on leading mechanisms of cerebral bioenergetic breakdown in the aging brain at the cellular level, as well as the putative causes and consequences of disturbed bioenergetics, particularly at the blood-brain barrier with implications for nutrient brain delivery and nutritional interventions. Novel therapeutic nutrition approaches including diet patterns are provided, integrating studies of the gut microbiome, neuroimaging, and other biomarkers to guide future personalized nutritional interventions.",

            "abstract": "Objective Our objective is to explore whether blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier biomarkers differ in episodic migraine (EM) or chronic migraine (CM) from controls. Background Reports of blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) disruption in migraine vary. Our hypothesis is that investigation of biomarkers associated with blood, CSF, brain, cell adhesion, and inflammation will help elucidate migraine pathophysiology. Methods We recruited 14 control volunteers without headache disorders and 42 individuals with EM or CM as classified using the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, criteria in a cross-sectional study located at our Pasadena and Stanford headache research centers in California. Blood and lumbar CSF samples were collected once from those diagnosed with CM or those with EM during two states: during a typical migraine, before rescue therapy, with at least 6/10 level of pain (ictal); and when migraine free for at least 48 h (interictal). The average number of headaches per month over the previous year was estimated by those with EM; this enabled comparison of biomarker changes between controls and three headache frequency groups: <2 per month, 2-14 per month, and CM. Blood and CSF biomarkers were determined using antibody-based methods. Results Antimigraine medication was only taken by the EM and CM groups. Compared to controls, the migraine group had significantly higher mean CSF-blood quotients of albumin (Q(alb): mean +/- standard deviation (SD): 5.6 +/- 2.3 vs. 4.1 +/- 1.9) and fibrinogen (Q(fib) mean +/- SD: 1615 +/- 99.0 vs. 86.1 +/- 55.0). Mean CSF but not plasma soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) levels were significantly higher in those with more frequent migraine: (4.5 ng/mL +/- 1.1 in those with <2 headache days a month; 5.5 +/- 1.9 with 2-14 days a month; and 7.1 +/- 2.9 in CM), while the Q(fib) ratio was inversely related to headache frequency. We did not find any difference in individuals with EM or CM from controls for CSF cell count, total protein, matrix metalloproteinase-9, soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, or C-reactive protein. Conclusions The higher Q(alb) and Q(fib) ratios may indicate that the transport of these blood-derived proteins is disturbed at the BCSFB in persons with migraine. These changes most likely occur at the choroid plexus epithelium, as there are no signs of typical endothelial barrier disruption. The most striking finding in this hypothesis-generating study of migraine pathophysiology is that sVCAM-1 levels in CSF may be a biomarker of higher frequency of migraine and CM. An effect from migraine medications cannot be excluded, but there is no known mechanism to suggest they have a role in altering the CSF biomarkers.",

            "abstract": "Insight into lipids' roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology is limited because brain membrane lipids have not been characterized in cognitively healthy (CH) individuals. Since age is a significant risk factor of AD, we hypothesize that aging renders the amyloid precursor protein (APP) more susceptible to abnormal processing because of deteriorating membrane lipids. To reflect brain membranes, we studied their lipid components in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain-derived CSF nanoparticle membranes. Based on CSF A beta(42)/Tau levels established biomarkers of AD, we define a subset of CH participants with normal A beta(42)/Tau (CH-NAT) and another group with abnormal or pathological A beta(42)/Tau (CH-PAT). We report that glycerophospholipids are differentially metabolized in the CSF supernatant fluid and nanoparticle membrane fractions from CH-NAT, CH-PAT, and AD participants. Phosphatidylcholine molecular species from the supernatant fraction of CH-PAT were higher than in the CH-NAT and AD participants. Sphingomyelin levels in the supernatant fraction were lower in the CH-PAT and AD than in the CH-NAT group. The decrease in sphingomyelin corresponded with an increase in ceramide and dihydroceramide and an increase in the ceramide to sphingomyelin ratio in AD. In contrast to the supernatant fraction, sphingomyelin is higher in the nanoparticle fraction from the CH-PAT group, accompanied by lower ceramide and dihydroceramide and a decrease in the ratio of ceramide to sphingomyelin in CH-PAT compared with CH-NAT. On investigating the mechanism for the lipid changes in AD, we observed that phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity was higher in the AD group than the CH groups. Paradoxically, acid and neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities were lower in AD compared to the CH groups. Considering external influences on lipids, the clinical groups did not differ in their fasting blood lipids or dietary lipids, consistent with the CSF lipid changes originating from brain pathophysiology. The lipid accumulation in a prodromal AD biomarker positive stage identifies perturbation of lipid metabolism and disturbances in APP/Amyloid beta (A beta) as early events in AD pathophysiology. Our results identify increased lipid turnover in CH participants with AD biomarkers, switching to a predominantly lipolytic state in dementia. This knowledge may be useful for targeting and testing new AD treatments.",

            "abstract": "Non-invasive biomarkers will enable widespread screening and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that the considerable loss of brain tissue in AD will result in detection of brain lipid components in urine, and that these will change in concert with CSF and brain biomarkers of AD. We examined urine dicarboxylic acids (DCA) of carbon length 3-10 to reflect products of oxidative damage and energy generation or balance that may account for changes in brain function in AD. Mean C4-C5 DCAs were lower and mean C7-C10 DCAs were higher in the urine from AD compared to cognitively healthy (CH) individuals. Moreover, mean C4-C5 DCAs were lower and mean C7-C9 were higher in urine from CH individuals with abnormal compared to normal CSF amyloid and Tau levels; i.e., the apparent urine changes in AD also appeared to be present in CH individuals that have CSF risk factors of early AD pathology. In examining the relationship between urine DCAs and AD biomarkers, we found short chain DCAs positively correlated with CSF A beta 42, while C7-C10 DCAs negatively correlated with CSF A beta 42 and positively correlated with CSF Tau levels. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation of C7-C10 DCAs with hippocampal volume (p < 0.01), which was not found in the occipital volume. Urine measures of DCAs have an 82% ability to predict cognitively healthy participants with normal CSF amyloid/Tau. These data suggest that urine measures of increased lipoxidation and dysfunctional energy balance reflect early AD pathology from brain and CSF biomarkers. Measures of urine DCAs may contribute to personalized healthcare by indicating AD pathology and may be utilized to explore population wellness or monitor the efficacy of therapies in clinical trials.",

            "abstract": "Our aim is to explore if cognitive challenge combined with objective physiology can reveal abnormal frontal alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD), in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to investigate brain activities during N-back working memory (WM) processing at two different load conditions (N = 0 or 2) in an aging cohort. We studied 60-100 year old participants, with normal cognition, and who fits one of two subgroups from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins: cognitively healthy (CH) with normal amyloid/tau ratio (CH-NAT, n = 10) or pathological amyloid/tau ratio (CH-PAT, n = 14). We recorded behavioral performances, and analyzed alpha power and alpha spectral entropy (SE) at three occasions: during the resting state, and at event-related desynchronization (ERD) [250 similar to 750 ms] during 0-back and 2-back. During 0-back WM testing, the behavioral performance was similar between the two groups, however, qEEG notably differentiated CH-PATs from CH-NATs on the simple, 0-back testing: Alpha ERD decreased from baseline only in the parietal region in CH-NATs, while it decreased in all brain regions in CH-PATs. Alpha SE did not change in CH-NATs, but was increased from baseline in the CH-PATs in frontal and left lateral regions (p<0.01), and was higher in the frontal region (p<0.01) of CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. The alpha ERD and SE analyses suggest there is frontal lobe dysfunction during WM processing in the CH-PAT stage. Additional power and correlations with behavioral performance were also explored. This study provide pilot information to further evaluate whether this biomarker has clinical significance.",

            "abstract": "Cardiotoxicity is a well-known pathophysiological consequence in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab. Trastuzumab related cardiotoxicity typically results in an overall decline in cardiac function, primarily characterized by reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and development of symptoms associated with heart failure. Current strategies for the monitoring of cardiac function, during trastuzumab therapy, includes serial echocardiography, which is cost ineffective as well as offers limited specificity, while offering limited potential in monitoring early onset of cardiotoxicity. However, biomarkers have been shown to be aberrant prior to any detectable functional or clinical deficit in cardiac function. Hence, this study aims to develop a panel of novel biomarkers and circulating miRNAs for the early screening of trastuzumab induced cardiotoxicity. Patients with clinical diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma were enrolled in the study, with blood specimen collected and echocardiography performed prior to trastuzumab therapy initiation at baseline, 3- and 6-months post trastuzumab therapy. Following 6-months of trastuzumab therapy, about 18% of the subjects developed cardiotoxicity, as defined by reduction in LVEF. Our results showed significant upregulation of biomarkers and circulating miRNAs, specific to cardiac injury and remodeling, at 3- and 6-months post trastuzumab therapy. These biomarkers and circulating miRNAs significantly correlated with the cardiac injury specific markers, troponin I and T. The findings in the present study demonstrates the translational applicability of the proposed biomarker panel in early preclinical diagnosis of trastuzumab induced cardiotoxicity, further allowing management of cardiac function decline and improved health outcomes for breast cancer patients.",

There is currently no standardized, minimally invasive, cost effective and clinically verified procedure to monitor cardiotoxicity post-anthracycline therapy initiation, and to detect early onset of irreversible cardiovascular complications. This study aims to create a panel of novel biomarkers and circulating miRNAs associated with cardiotoxicity, further assessing their correlation with cardiac injury specific markers, troponin I and T, and demonstrate the development of cardiac dysfunction in breast cancer patients. Blood obtained from West Virginian females clinically diagnosed with breast cancer and receiving anthracyclines showed upregulated level of biomarkers and circulating miRNAs after 3 and 6 months of chemotherapy initiation with increased levels of cardiac troponin I and T. These biomarkers and miRNAs significantly correlated with elevated troponins. Following 6 months of anthracycline-regimens, 23% of the patient population showed cardiotoxicity with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Our results support the clinical application of plasma biomarkers and circulating miRNAs to develop a panel for early diagnosis of chemotherapy related cardiac dysfunction which will enable early detection of disease progression and management of irreversible cardiac damage.",

            "abstract": "Objective High BMI predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes and positively correlates with increased levels of adipokines. The relationship among BMI, IL-6, TNF alpha, adiponectin, and oxidized high-density lipoprotein (Ox-HDL) with circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has not been well studied. Elevated CEC levels have been described in both humans and mice with obesity and diabetes. Ox-HDL has been shown to be a potent driver of adipogenesis in vivo and in vitro. In this study, elevated BMI was examined in 2 groups of women studied in Brooklyn, New York, and Huntington, West Virginia, respectively. Methods Twenty-six females with obesity and five lean controls without overt cardiovascular disease were enrolled, 13 from Huntington and 13 from Brooklyn. Cytokine levels, EPCs, and CECs were determined. Results Females with obesity had elevated levels of leptin, IL-6, and Ox-HDL, increased CEC levels, and decreased EPC and adiponectin levels (all P < 0.01). The Ox-HDL levels were higher in women from Brooklyn versus Huntington (P < 0.01), possibly from higher TNF alpha levels in Brooklyn or higher adiponectin levels in Huntington. Seventy-five percent of the variance in Ox-HDL levels could be predicted in this population (P < 0.01). Conclusions This study reveals a unique inflammatory biomarker profile in females with obesity.",

            "abstract": "The study by Lowe et al. uses magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the biomarker potential of neurochemical metabolites in Huntington's disease. Cross-sectional associations were observed between metabolites and prognostic measures; however, the absence of consistent group differences and lack of clear longitudinal change indicates limited biomarker potential in Huntington's disease. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive method of exploring cerebral metabolism. In Huntington's disease, altered proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy-determined concentrations of several metabolites have been described; however, findings are often discrepant and longitudinal studies are lacking. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolites may represent a source of biomarkers, thus their relationship with established markers of disease progression require further exploration to assess prognostic value and elucidate pathways associated with neurodegeneration. In a prospective single-site controlled cohort study with standardized collection of CSF, blood, phenotypic and volumetric imaging data, we used 3 T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in conjunction with the linear combination of model spectra method to quantify seven metabolites (total n-acetylaspartate, total creatine, total choline, myo-inositol, GABA, glutamate and glutathione) in the putamen of 59 participants at baseline (15 healthy controls, 15 premanifest and 29 manifest Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers) and 48 participants at 2-year follow-up (12 healthy controls, 13 premanifest and 23 manifest Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers). Intergroup differences in concentration and associations with CSF and plasma biomarkers; including neurofilament light chain and mutant Huntingtin, volumetric imaging markers; namely whole brain, caudate, grey matter and white matter volume, measures of disease progression and cognitive decline, were assessed cross-sectionally using generalized linear models and partial correlation. We report no significant groupwise differences in metabolite concentration at baseline but found total creatine and total n-acetylaspartate to be significantly reduced in manifest compared with premanifest participants at follow-up. Additionally, total creatine and myo-inositol displayed significant associations with reduced caudate volume across both time points in gene expansion carriers. Although relationships were observed between proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolites and biofluid measures, these were not consistent across time points. To further assess prognostic value, we examined whether baseline proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy values, or rate of change, predicted subsequent change in established measures of disease progression. Several associations were found but were inconsistent across known indicators of disease progression. Finally, longitudinal mixed-effects models revealed glutamine + glutamate to display a slow linear decrease over time in gene expansion carriers. Altogether, our findings show some evidence of reduced total n-acetylaspartate and total creatine as the disease progresses and cross-sectional associations between select metabolites, namely total creatine and myo-inositol, and markers of disease progression, potentially highlighting the proposed roles of neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction in disease pathogenesis. However, the absence of consistent group differences, inconsistency between baseline and follow-up, and lack of clear longitudinal change suggests that proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolites have limited potential as Huntington's disease biomarkers.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the order and progression of change in biomarkers of neurodegeneration is essential to detect the effects of pharmacological interventions on these biomarkers. In Huntington's disease (HD), motor, cognitive and MRI biomarkers are currently used in clinical trials of drug efficacy. Here for the first time we use directly compare data from three large observational studies of HD (total N = 532) using a probabilistic event-based model (EBM) to characterise the order in which motor, cognitive and MRI biomarkers become abnormal. We also investigate the impact of the genetic cause of HD, cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length, on progression through these stages. We find that EBM uncovers a broadly consistent order of events across all three studies; that EBM stage reflects clinical stage; and that EBM stage is related to age and genetic burden. Our findings indicate that measures of subcortical and white matter volume become abnormal prior to clinical and cognitive biomarkers. Importantly, CAG repeat length has a large impact on the timing of onset of each stage and progression through the stages, with a longer repeat length resulting in earlier onset and faster progression. Our results can be used to help design clinical trials of treatments for Huntington's disease, influencing the choice of biomarkers and the recruitment of participants.",

BDNF function is reduced in Huntington's disease (HD), possibly because mutant huntingtin impairs its cortico-striatal transport, contributing to striatal neurodegeneration. The BDNF trophic pathway is a therapeutic target, and blood BDNF has been suggested as a potential biomarker for HD, but BDNF has not been quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in HD. We quantified BDNF in CSF and plasma in the HD-CSF cohort (20 pre-manifest and 40 manifest HD mutation carriers and 20 age and gender-matched controls) using conventional ELISAs and an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. BDNF concentration was below the limit of detection of the conventional ELISAs, raising doubt about previous CSF reports in neurodegeneration. Using the ultra-sensitive method, BDNF concentration was quantifiable in all samples but did not differ between controls and HD mutation carriers in CSF or plasma, was not associated with clinical scores or MRI brain volumetric measures, and had poor ability to discriminate controls from HD mutation carriers, and premanifest from manifest HD. We conclude that BDNF in CSF and plasma is unlikely to be a biomarker of HD progression and urge caution in interpreting studies where conventional ELISA was used to quantify CSF BDNF.",

Characterizing changes in these candidates during disease progression could increase our understanding of disease pathophysiology and help the identification of effective therapies. In an 80-participant cohort over 24 months, mHTT in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as NfL in CSF and blood, had distinct longitudinal trajectories in HD mutation carriers compared with controls. Baseline analyte values predicted clinical disease status, subsequent clinical progression, and brain atrophy, better than did the rate of change in analytes. Overall, NfL was a stronger monitoring and prognostic biomarker for HD than mHTT. Nonetheless, mHTT has prognostic value and might be a valuable pharmacodynamic marker for huntingtin-lowering trials.",

            "abstract": "Background Disease-modifying treatments are in development for Huntington's disease; crucial to their success is to identify a timepoint in a patient's life when there is a measurable biomarker of early neurodegeneration while clinical function is still intact. We aimed to identify this timepoint in a novel cohort of young adult premanifest Huntington's disease gene carriers (preHD) far from predicted clinical symptom onset. Methods We did the Huntington's disease Young Adult Study (HD-YAS) in the UK. We recruited young adults with preHD and controls matched for age, education, and sex to ensure each group had at least 60 participants with imaging data, accounting for scan fails. Controls either had a family history of Huntington's disease but a negative genetic test, or no known family history of Huntington's disease. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments, including tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and a battery assessing emotion, motivation, impulsivity and social cognition (EMOTICOM). Imaging (done for all participants without contraindications) included volumetric MRI, diffusion imaging, and multiparametric mapping. Biofluid markers of neuronal health were examined using blood and CSF collection. We did a cross-sectional analysis using general least-squares linear models to assess group differences and associations with age and CAG length, relating to predicted years to clinical onset. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR), with FDR <0.05 deemed a significant result. Findings Data were obtained between Aug 2, 2017, and April 25, 2019. We recruited 64 young adults with preHD and 67 controls. Mean ages of participants were 29.0 years (SD 5.6) and 29.1 years (5.7) in the preHD and control groups, respectively. We noted no significant evidence of cognitive or psychiatric impairment in preHD participants 23.6 years (SD 5.8) from predicted onset (FDR 0.22-0.87 for cognitive measures, 0.31-0.91 for neuropsychiatric measures). The preHD cohort had slightly smaller putamen volumes (FDR=0.03), but this did not appear to be closely related to predicted years to onset (FDR=0.54). There were no group differences in other brain imaging measures (FDR >0.16). CSF neurofilament light protein (NfL), plasma NfL, and CSF YKL-40 were elevated in this far-from-onset preHD cohort compared with controls (FDR<0.0001, =0.01, and =0.03, respectively). CSF NfL elevations were more likely in individuals closer to expected clinical onset (FDR <0.0001). Interpretation We report normal brain function yet a rise in sensitive measures of neurodegeneration in a preHD cohort approximately 24 years from predicted clinical onset. CSF NfL appears to be a more sensitive measure than plasma NfL to monitor disease progression. This preHD cohort is one of the earliest yet studied, and our findings could be used to inform decisions about when to initiate a potential future intervention to delay or prevent further neurodegeneration while function is intact.",

            "abstract": "Objective The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD. Methods We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT-HD, TRACK-HD, and IMAGE-HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease-affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers. Results We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (>0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of >80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers. Interpretation Our findings provide the first cross-study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials.

            "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a group of diseases caused by chronic and progressive degeneration of neural tissue. The main pathological manifestations are neuronal degeneration and loss in the brain and/or spinal cord. Common NDDs include Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The complicated pathological characteristics and different clinical manifestations of NDDs result in a lack of sensitive and efficient diagnostic methods. In addition, no sensitive biomarkers are available to monitor the course of NDDs, predict their prognosis, and monitor the therapeutic response. Despite extensive research in recent years, analysis of amyloid beta (A beta) and alpha-synuclein has failed to effectively improve NDD diagnosis. Although recent studies have indicated circulating miRNAs as promising diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs, the miRNA in the peripheral circulation is susceptible to interference by other components, making circulating miRNA results less consistent. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with a diameter of approximately 30-100 nm that transport proteins, lipids, mRNA, and miRNA. Because recent studies have shown that exosomes have a double-membrane structure that can resist ribonuclease in the blood, giving exosomal miRNA high stability and making them resistant to degradation, they may become an ideal biomarker of circulating fluids. In this review, we discuss the applicability of circulating exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers, highlight the technical aspects of exosomal miRNA analysis, and review studies that have used circulating exosomal miRNAs as candidate diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs.",

Methods There were 167 subjects, including 100 with HCC and 67 with LC, who were enrolled into this study. Serum AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP levels were detected by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay and analyzed using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) method. Results The sensitivity and specificity of AFP and DCP for differentiating between early HCC and HBV-associated LC were 51.5% and 92.5%, and 60.0% and 84.7%, respectively. Comparative analysis of ROC curves showed no significant difference in the area under the curve (AUC) for AFP and DCP. Moreover, the combination of AFP and DCP showed the largest AUC value with a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 83.1%, respectively. Conclusion These results suggest that AFP is the best single biomarker for distinguishing between HBV-associated LC and early HCC induced by HBV. However, the combination of AFP and DCP can enhance the diagnostic value of AFP for differentiating between these diseases.",

            "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a pathologic feature of neurodegeneration and aging; however, the mechanism regulating this process is not understood. Melatonin, an endogenous free radical scavenger synthesized by neuronal mitochondria, decreases with aging and neurodegeneration. We proposed that insufficient melatonin levels impair mitochondrial homeostasis, resulting in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release and activation of cytosolic DNA-mediated inflammatory response in neurons. We found increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, with higher mtONA release in brain and primary cerebro-cortical neurons of melatonin-deficient aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) knockout mice. Cytosolic mtDNA activated the cGAS/STING/IRF3 pathway, stimulating inflammatory cytokine generation. We found that Huntington's disease mice had increased mtDNA release, cGAS activation, and inflammation, all inhibited by exogenous melatonin. Thus, we demonstrated that cytosolic mtDNA activated the inflammatory response in aging and neurodegeneration, a process modulated by melatonin. Furthermore, our data suggest that AANAT knockout mice are a model of accelerated aging.",

            "abstract": "Background: DNA methylation at the fifth position of cytosine (5mC) is a common epigenetic alteration affecting a range of cellular processes. In recent years, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an oxidized form of 5mC, has risen broad interests as a potential biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis and survival. Methods: We analyzed the epigenome-wide 5hmC profiles of paired lung tumor and adjacent normal tissues, using the TET-Assisted Bisulfite (TAB) array - Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC) approach. The differentially methylated CpG sites were identified, and the biological relevance of 5hmC was assessed by differential methylation regions (DMR) analysis and gene set analysis (GSA). Results: We observed global hypomethylation of 5hmC comparing tumor to normal tissues, and hypermethylated 5hmC were enriched in CpG islands and gene upstream. Comparison of 5hmC and 5modC (total methylation: 5mC + 5hmC) profiling showed low correlation, and only a small proportion of the significant 5hmC loci overlapped with the significant total methylation loci. GSA analysis suggested that 5hmC was mainly involved in biological processes such as cellular process, biological regulation, and metabolic process. Conclusion: This is the first study to analyze the epigenome-wide 5hmC profiles among paired lung tumor and normal tissues. We observed global hypomethylation of 5hmC in lung cancers, and hypermethylated 5hmC enriched in CpG islands and gene upstream. We found that the genome-wide 5hmC levels do not correlate with the total methylation, and the GSA suggested different biological functions of 5hmC compared to 5modC. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of 5hmC as a novel biomarker for lung cancer.",

            "abstract": "Potential disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative disorders need to be introduced prior to the symptomatic stage in order to be effective. However, current diagnosis of neurological disorders mostly rely on measurements of clinical symptoms and thus only identify symptomatic subjects in their late disease course. Thus, it is of interest to select and integrate biomarkers that may reflect early disease-related pathological changes for earlier diagnosis and recruiting pre-sypmtomatic subjects in a prevention clinical trial. Two sources of biological information are relevant to the construction of biomarker signatures for time to disease onset that is subject to right censoring. First, biomarkers' effects on disease onset may vary with a subject's baseline disease stage indicated by a particular marker. Second, biomarkers may be connected through networks, and their effects on disease may be informed by this network structure. To leverage these information, we propose a varying-coefficient hazards model to induce double smoothness over the dimension of the disease stage and over the space of network-structured biomarkers. The distinctive feature of the model is a non-parametric effect that captures non-linear change according to the disease stage and similarity among the effects of linked biomarkers. For estimation and feature selection, we use kernel smoothing of a regularized local partial likelihood and derive an efficient algorithm. Numeric simulations demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in performance and computational efficiency. Finally, the methods are applied to our motivating study, a recently completed study of Huntington's disease (HD), where structural brain imaging measures are used to inform age-at-onset of HD and assist clinical trial design. The analysis offers new insights on the structural network signatures for premanifest HD subjects.",

            "abstract": "Biomarkers are often organized into networks, in which the strengths of network connections vary across subjects depending on subject-specific covariates (eg, genetic variants). Variation of network connections, as subject-specific feature variables, has been found to predict disease clinical outcome. In this work, we develop a two-stage method to estimate biomarker networks that account for heterogeneity among subjects and evaluate network's association with disease clinical outcome. In the first stage, we propose a conditional Gaussian graphical model with mean and precision matrix depending on covariates to obtain covariate-dependent networks with connection strengths varying across subjects while assuming homogeneous network structure. In the second stage, we evaluate clinical utility of network measures (connection strengths) estimated from the first stage. The second-stage analysis provides the relative predictive power of between-region network measures on clinical impairment in the context of regional biomarkers and existing disease risk factors. We assess the performance of proposed method by extensive simulation studies and application to a Huntington's disease (HD) study to investigate the effect of HD causal gene on the rate of change in motor symptom through affecting brain subcortical and cortical gray matter atrophy connections. We show that cortical network connections and subcortical volumes, but not subcortical connections are identified to be predictive of clinical motor function deterioration. We validate these findings in an independent HD study. Lastly, highly similar patterns seen in the gray matter connections and a previous white matter connectivity study suggest a shared biological mechanism for HD and support the hypothesis that white matter loss is a direct result of neuronal loss as opposed to the loss of myelin or dysmyelination.",

            "abstract": "Neurological diseases are due to the loss of structure or function of neurons that eventually leads to cognitive deficit, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and impaired activities of daily living. Identifying sensitive and specific biological and clinical markers for early diagnosis allows recruiting patients into a clinical trial to test therapeutic intervention. However, many biomarker studies considered a single biomarker at one time that fails to provide precise prediction for disease age at onset. In this paper, we use longitudinally collected measurements from multiple biomarkers and measurement error-corrected clinical diagnosis ages to identify which biomarkers and what features of biomarker trajectories are useful for early diagnosis. Specifically, we assume that the subject-specific biomarker trajectories depend on unobserved states of underlying latent variables with the conditional mean follows a nonlinear sigmoid shape. We show that peak degeneration age of the biomarker trajectory is useful for early diagnosis. We propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of all parameters and conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the performance of the proposed methods. Finally, we apply our methods to studies of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease and identify a few important biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "We present a method for empirically modeling and optimizing variations in sputtering deposition processes using Gaussian Process (GP) machine learning methods. Our predictive models can be trained with limited training data to enable rapid sputtering process tuning. As a first case, we model the effect of process recipe parameters such as chamber pressure and power on sputtered film thickness uniformity. A second more challenging case is also demonstrated: modeling film thickness spatial uniformity as a function of equipment configuration parameters. The effects of the chamber configuration variables are complex, motivating incorporation of prior process knowledge into the GP framework by utilizing a physics-based solver. Because adjusting equipment configuration parameters and obtaining corresponding wafer fabrication data is costly, a key metric is the expected number of tunes required until process constraints are met. Using past experimental data, we show that tunes using the GP-based predictive model are expected to converge in significantly fewer iterations compared to tunes using polynomial, gradient boosted regression tree, multivariate spline, and deep learning based modeling methods.",

            "abstract": "We present a one-class anomaly detection method that uses time series sensor data to detect anomalies or faults in semiconductor fabrication processes. Critically, this method is trained using only small amounts of known successful run data, making it possible to implement for many processes and recipes without needing example faults. The proposed method uses kernel density estimation (KDE) to create probability distributions for sensor values during nominal processing. When classifying unseen sensor data, we determine the likelihood that it arose from this (often non-Gaussian) nominal distribution, allowing us to classify new signals as nominal, or faulty. We present model extensions that enable adaptation to changes in the underlying process, i.e., concept drift, as well as transfer learning techniques that enable training of anomaly detectors for new process recipes with less data. The proposed methods are tested on historical data from plasma etch and ion implantation processes, outperforming benchmark methods including traditional statistical process control (SPC), one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), and variational auto-encoder (VAE) based detectors.",

            "abstract": "Spatial dose non-uniformity is a key variation of concern in ion implantation. These non-uniformities are often compensated for by adjusting the implantation times spent at each point on the wafer: areas with a low uncompensated dose are assigned more implantation time, while those with a greater dose are assigned reduced times. In this paper, we present a machine learning based method that rapidly learns a set of compensating implantation times in order to achieve a desired uniformity.We propose an iterative tuning approach comprised of two components. The first component is an empirical Bayesian forward model that infers the relationship between the implantation times and the implantation dose profile. The model is updated as new implantations are performed and measured, enabling progressive accuracy improvements during tuning. The second component is an optimization method that selects compensating times by solving a constrained optimization problem. When tuning a process, we alternate between these two components, repeatedly selecting compensating times, measuring the resulting dose profile and updating the model until the desired uniformity is achieved. Our proposed method is compared to the conventional non-Bayesian industry method of record, and converges to a desired uniformity in significantly fewer iterations. Finally, the solutions found by our method result in a greater total dose given the same total implantation time and uniformity, increasing the throughput of implantation with no added cost.",

            "abstract": "The role of electricity theft detection (ETD) is critical to maintain cost-efficiency in smart grids. However, existing ETD methods cannot efficiently handle the sheer volume of data now available, being limited by issues such as missing values, high variance and non-linearity. An integrated infrastructure is also required for synchronizing diverse procedures in electricity theft classification. To help address such problems, a novel ETD framework is proposed that combines three distinct modules. The first module handles missing values, outliers, and unstandardised electricity consumption data. The second module employs a newly proposed hybrid class balancing approach to deal with highly imbalanced datasets. The third module utilises an improved artificial neural network (iANN) based classification engine, to predict electricity theft cases accurately and efficiently. We propose three distinctive mechanisms, including hyper-parameters tuning, regularization and skip connections, to improve the performance of standard ANN to handle more complex classification tasks using smart meter (SM) data. Furthermore, various structures of iANN are investigated to improve the generalization and function fitting capabilities of the final classification. Numerical results from real-world energy usage datasets confirm that the proposed ETD model has superior performance compared to existing machine learning and deep learning methods, and can effectively be applied to industrial applications.",

            "abstract": "The role of electricity theft detection (ETD) is critical to maintain cost-efficiency in smart grids. However, existing methods for theft detection can struggle to handle large electricity consumption datasets because of missing values, data variance and nonlinear data relationship problems, and there is a lack of integrated infrastructure for coordinating electricity load data analysis procedures. To help address these problems, a simple yet effective ETD model is developed. Three modules are combined into the proposed model. The first module deploys a combination of data imputation, outlier handling, normalization and class balancing algorithms, to enhance the time series characteristics and generate better quality data for improved training and learning by the classifiers. Three different machine learning (ML) methods, which are uncorrelated and skillful on the problem in different ways, are employed as the base learning model. Finally, a recently developed deep learning approach, namely a temporal convolutional network (TCN), is used to ensemble the outputs of the ML algorithms for improved classification accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed framework yields a highly-accurate, robust classification performance, in comparison to other well-established machine and deep learning models and thus can be a practical tool for electricity theft detection in industrial applications.",

            "abstract": "Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is important in industrial systems. It prevents machines from working under failure conditions, and ensures that the industrial system works reliably and efficiently. Recently, many deep learning based methods have been proposed to predict RUL. Among these methods, recurrent neural network (RNN) based approaches show a strong capability of capturing sequential information. This allows RNN based methods to perform better than convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches on the RUL prediction task. In this paper, we question this common paradigm and argue that existing CNN based approaches are not designed according to the classic principles of CNN, which reduces their performances. Additionally, the capacity of capturing sequential information is highly affected by the receptive field of CNN, which is neglected by existing CNN based methods. To solve these problems, we propose a series of new CNNs, which show competitive results to RNN based methods. Compared with RNN, CNN processes the input signals in parallel so that the temporal sequence is not easily determined. To alleviate this issue, a position encoding scheme is developed to enhance the sequential information encoded by a CNN. Hence, our proposed position encoding based CNN called PE-Net is further improved and even performs better than RNN based methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on the C-MAPSS dataset, where our PE-Net shows state-of-the-art performance.",

            "abstract": "In industry, prognostics and health management (PHM) is used to improve the system reliability and efficiency. In PHM, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction plays a key role in preventing machine failure and reducing operation cost. Recently, with the development of deep learning technology, long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are adopted into many RUL prediction approaches, which shows impressive performances. However, existing deep learning-based methods directly utilize raw signals. Since noise widely exists in raw signals, the quality of these approaches’ feature representation is degraded, which degenerates their RUL prediction accuracy. To address this issue, we first propose a series of new handcrafted feature flows (HFFs), which can suppress the raw signal noise and thus improve the encoded sequential information for the RUL prediction. In addition, to effectively integrate our proposed HFFs with the raw input signals, a novel bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)-based two-stream network is proposed. In this novel two-stream network, three different fusion methods are designed to investigate how to combine both streams’ feature representations in a reasonable way. To verify our proposed Bi-LSTM-based two-stream network, extensive experiments are carried out on the commercial modular aero propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset, showing superior performances over state-of-the-art approaches.",

            "abstract": "Deep transfer learning provides a feasible fault diagnosis method for intelligent mechanical systems. However, this method usually assumes that the source domain and the target domain have the same label space, which greatly limits its application in the actual industry. Therefore, this article proposes a multidiscriminator deep weighted adversarial network (MDWAN) method, which is especially suitable for partial transfer learning where the number of target domain categories is less than the source domain. The proposed method is mainly composed of three parts: feature extractor, multidiscriminator, and classifier. In the feature extraction section, a deep separable convolutional neural network model (DSC) is proposed, which can greatly reduce parameter calculation amount under the premise of ensuring the extraction accuracy. In the multidiscriminator section, a multidiscriminator weighted learning strategy is proposed. This strategy comprehensively considers the domain information and source domain label information, and introduces a weight function to quantify the contribution of source domain samples to the domain discriminator and classifier, which can effectively identify and filter outlier source samples to promote the positive transfer of shared samples. In order to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, the method is applied to three types of bearing datasets of different machines. Comparing the classification results of different methods, the conclusion shows that this method is more beneficial for bearing fault classification.",

            "abstract": "Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is a real-time monitoring technology for the visualization of industrial dynamic processes. Due to the inherent nonlinearity and ill-posed nature of the ECT inverse problem, achieving fast and accurate image reconstruction remains a great challenge. A novel multilevel densely connected network with channelwise thresholds (MDCN-CW) is proposed, which adopts a deep-learning framework to implement a reconstruction process similar to iterative algorithms. MDCN-CW is a highly condensed framework that achieves efficient information transfer through dense connections between and within subnetworks, and soft thresholding is inserted into the subnetwork as a nonlinear transformation layer to eliminate unimportant features. Matching the purpose and structure of MDCN-CW, a phased strategy is used to train it. Each subnetwork is first trained with a stepwise individual strategy, and network parameters are fine-tuned after all subnetworks are integrated to improve the overall fit of the model. Simulation and experimental results show that, compared with existing deep-learning-based reconstruction methods and traditional algorithms, the proposed ECT image reconstruction network with soft thresholds has the advantages of simple structure, high imaging accuracy, and good generalization ability.",

            "abstract": "A Digital Twin is a digital replica of a living or nonliving physical entity, and this emerging technology attracted extensive attention from different industries during the past decade. Although a few Digital Twin studies have been conducted in the transportation domain very recently, there is no systematic research with a holistic framework connecting various mobility entities together. In this study, a mobility digital twin (MDT) framework is developed, which is defined as an artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven cloud–edge–device framework for mobility services. This MDT consists of three building blocks in the physical space (namely, Human, Vehicle, and Traffic), and their associated Digital Twins in the digital space. An example cloud–edge architecture is built with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to accommodate the proposed MDT framework and to fulfill its digital functionalities of storage, modeling, learning, simulation, and prediction. A case study of the personalized adaptive cruise control (P-ACC) system is conducted, which integrates the key microservices of all three digital building blocks of the MDT framework: 1) the Human Digital Twin with user management and driver type classification; 2) the Vehicle Digital Twin with cloud-based advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS); and 3) the Traffic Digital Twin with traffic flow monitoring and variable speed limit. Future challenges of the proposed MDT framework are discussed toward the end of the article, including standardization, AI for computing, public or private cloud service, and network heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) are significantly changing informative and manufacturing pattern in smart factories while it also brings security and trustworthiness issue. Concerning about trustworthiness issues and private preservation of tracking systems, a hierarchical framework with federated control theory is designed, which consists of a federated control center, network layer, and a federated control node. The framework combines a collaborative Cloud-Edge-End structure and machine learning-oriented localization, which further forms the EM-based federated scheme. On this basis, a trustworthy localization model is built with the untrustworthiness probability as a latent variable. By exploring expectation maximization (EM) of trustworthy localization, the local messages and aggression equations are derived in an iterative way of federated learning. The EM-based federated control scheme with machine learning-oriented localization is finally given. Experiments have been conducted to prove the localization accuracy and convergence of the proposed method with trustworthiness issue. The results show that trustworthy localization outperforms traditional methods without considering the security threats.",

With properly designed electrode structures and materials, different types of conductance distributions with large variations are achieved, allowing the PUF to function in differential or on/off modes. The uniqueness of the PUF is verified with inter Hamming distance and entropy at different temperatures. The PUF is shown to be resistant to machine learning attack based on Fourier extrapolation. The proposed fingerprint PUF is compatible with back-end-of-line (BEOL) process and offers potential for hardware security primitive in IoT industry.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has led to significant steps forward in many industries, thanks to the exploitation of several technologies, ranging from Big Data processing to artificial intelligence (AI). Among the various IIoT scenarios, large-scale data centers can reap significant benefits from adopting Big Data analytics and AI-boosted approaches since these technologies can allow effective predictive maintenance. However, most of the off-the-shelf currently available solutions are not ideally suited to the high-performance computing (HPC) context, e.g., they do not sufficiently take into account the very heterogeneous data sources and the privacy issues that hinder the adoption of the cloud solution, or they do not fully exploit the computing capabilities available in loco in a supercomputing facility. In this article, we tackle this issue, and we propose an IIoT holistic and vertical framework for predictive maintenance in supercomputers. The framework is based on a big lightweight data monitoring infrastructure, specialized databases suited for heterogeneous data, and a set of high-level AI-based functionalities tailored to HPC actors’ specific needs. We present the deployment and assess the usage of this framework in several in-production HPC systems.",

            "abstract": "In their quest toward Exascale, High Performance Computing (HPC) systems are rapidly becoming larger and more complex, together with the issues concerning their maintenance. Luckily, many current HPC systems are endowed with data monitoring infrastructures that characterize the system state, and whose data can be used to train Deep Learning (DL) anomaly detection models, a very popular research area. However, the lack of labels describing the state of the system is a wide-spread issue, as annotating data is a costly task, generally falling on human system administrators and thus does not scale toward exascale. In this article we investigate the possibility to extract labels from a service monitoring tool (Nagios) currently used by HPC system administrators to flag the nodes which undergo maintenance operations. This allows to automatically annotate data collected by a fine-grained monitoring infrastructure; this labelled data is then used to train and validate a DL model for anomaly detection. We conduct the experimental evaluation on a tier-0 production supercomputer hosted at CINECA, Bologna, Italy. The results reveal that the DL model can accurately detect the real failures, and, moreover, it can predict the insurgency of anomalies, by systematically anticipating the actual labels (i.e., the moment when system administrators realize when an anomalous event happened); the average advance time computed on historical traces is around 45 minutes. The proposed technology can be easily scaled toward exascale systems to easy their maintenance.",

However, the issues of the current RL setting ranging from inappropriate battery state-of-charge (SOC) constraint to ineffective and risky exploration make it inapplicable to many industrial energy management strategy (EMS) tasks. To address this, an adaptive hierarchical EMS combining heuristic equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) knowledge and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), which is a state-of-the-art data-driven RL algorithm, is proposed in this work. For comparison purposes, the proposed strategy is contrasted with dynamic programming (DP), proportion integration differentiation (PID)-based adaptive ECMS, and rule-based and standard RL-based counterparts, and the results show that the fuel consumption after SOC correction for the proposed strategy is very close to that of the DP-based control and lower than that of the other three benchmark strategies. Considering that the proposed strategy can make better use of the RL techniques while realizing an effective, efficient, and safe exploration in a data-driven manner, it may become a strong foothold for future RL-based EMS to build on, especially when the controller has to be trained directly and from scratch in a real-world environment.",

However, the issues of current RL algorithms including deployment inefficiency, safety constraint, and simulation-to-real gap make it inapplicable to many industrial EMS tasks. With these in mind and considering the fact that there exists many suboptimal EMS controllers which can generate plentiful amounts of interactive data containing informative behaviors, an offline RL training framework that tries to extract policies with the maximum possible utility out of the available offline data is proposed. Furthermore, with connected vehicle technology standard in many new cars, rather than bringing all the data to the storage and analytics, a scheduled training framework is put forward. This cloud-based approach not only alleviates the computational burden of edge devices, but also more importantly provides a deployment-efficient solution to EMS tasks that have to adapt to changes of driving cycle. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real controllers, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test is performed and the superiority of the proposed algorithm in contrast to dynamic programming, behavior cloning, rule-based, and vanilla off-policy RL algorithms is given.",

            "abstract": "Data-driven approaches have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in battery’s state of health (SOH) estimation; however, they are susceptible to data quality and quantity. Therefore, an accurate data-based battery health estimation method is highly desirable in an unreliable industry environment when sensors’ random measurements unavailability is ubiquitous. Successful training under random data unavailability becomes a difficult task to undertake. Therefore, the main challenge is how an offline trained model can be reliable and accurate under random sensors’ measurements unavailability. This article develops an accurate SOH estimation model based on nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs recurrent neural network for lithium-ion batteries whose features’ measurements are subjected to different random missing observations. To evoke the uncertainty of sensors’ measurements in online health diagnostic, missing observation occurrence is addressed by randomly eliminating sample data and then evaluating the model on the available measurements. Therefore, it does not require any imputation strategy for missing values. The accuracy of the estimator model is guaranteed when extracted underlying features are fused by adding their exponential moving average as the health features. The experimental results on two different datasets, Oxford and Toyota, under different battery chemistry and working operations demonstrate that the mean absolute errors (MAEs) and RMSs are well bounded below 2.70% and 3.10% for different random data missing rates of 1%–30%. It is a promising prediction model for numerous industrial applications with a high probability of random data unavailability.",

            "abstract": "Long horizon state of health (SOH) monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction are of industrial value in prognostic and health management (PHM) of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) to ensure their reliable functionality by early detection. Machine Learning, as a data-driven health diagnostic technique, has been widely utilized in solitary and hybrid structures. However, an accurate SOH estimation and RUL prediction method with less computational burden are highly desirable for the online state prediction in an electric vehicle application. This paper evaluates nonlinear autoregressive with external input (NARX) recurrent neural network (RNN) and time delay neural network (TDNN) in their prediction precision using the NASA dataset. The superior method, NARXRNN, is employed for two different datasets to estimate the battery's SOH and predict its RUL on a broad horizon. The results reveal the outstanding performance by presenting the root mean square error within 3% and mean absolute error within 2% for unseen data. Therefore, this method is capable to accurately predict the SOH of LIBS from historical data at low computational complexity. It is a promising model for long horizon SOH and RUL prediction and practical for online applications.",

            "abstract": "Thermomechanical processes (TMPs) such as resistance spot welding (RSW) and hot stamping are widely used in automotive manufacturing. Recent advancement in sensing technology has led to an increasing adoption of thermographic cameras to capture the infrared (IR) radiation of a metal part (or component of a part) during its thermomechanical processing or immediately after the process when the part is still hot. Detecting the object(s) of interest from raw IR images is an essential step in analyzing these data. Deep learning (DL) has been a recent success for object detection (OD), but the application of DL-based OD for industrial IR images in manufacturing is largely lagging behind. The major contribution of this work, which is also the distinction from previous OD studies, is the capability of building the OD model with unlabeled IR images, i.e., imaging data without accurate information indicating the object position. The architecture of Unsupervised IR Image Net (UIR-Net) is designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of IR images from TMPs in manufacturing. This study presents a novel method for OD in unlabeled IR images from TMPs. The proposed method, called UIR-Net, consists of two components: label generation and DL model construction. Two case studies from automotive manufacturing, RSW and hot stamping, are reported to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the problem of detecting objects such as weld nugget or metal piece in infrared (IR) imaging of thermomechanical processes (TMPs) in automotive manufacturing. The method is applicable to in situ IR images or videos that contain one or more objects to be detected. It only requires that the data are in image form and come from TMPs. Currently, there is no existing deep learning (DL)-based method for generic object detection (OD) in unlabeled IR images from TMPs. The proposed method takes advantages of the recent advancement in DL. This article suggests a systematic approach to build a DL-based OD model, named Unsupervised IR Image Net (UIR-Net), to extract objects from raw IR images collected for TMPs. A step-by-step procedure is given in this article to guide users through label generation, data quality evaluation, and model training to establish the proposed UIR-Net model. Results from resistance spot welding and hot stamping suggest that this approach is feasible and effective. It is one of the few generic OD works designed for manufacturing applications. Simple implementation, feasibility, and effectiveness make this method a suitable candidate for online data analytics and process monitoring in a wide range of manufacturing applications.",

            "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) arise due to multisensor data collection in manufacturing. These data are complex in the sense that attributes have a varying scale, volitivity, continuity, and so on, and interattribute dependence also appears, which can mask the inherent information about system health status. Conventional machine learning-based process monitoring techniques are inefficient in predicting faults with MTS—their detection capability heavily relies on the input features, yet the classification power of MTS attributes is weakened by the complexity of multisensor data. Effective feature extraction is, therefore, necessary to facilitate fault prediction with MTS. This study proposes a fault prediction framework for MTS based on bag-of-words (BOW) feature extraction, statistical feature selection, and classification analysis. BOW models are for the first time adopted in a manufacturing context. Their superior capability in information preservation, local pattern recognition, and temporal effect accommodation has overcome the major limitations in current manufacturing practices with MTS. A comprehensive case study demonstrates the desirable performance of this framework on two MTS data sets from paper manufacturing and automotive manufacturing, as well as its superiority over conventional machine learning-based fault prediction. Note to Practitioners—Process monitoring in a multisensor environment has been a vital interest in manufacturing. The difficulty lies in the lack of detection power in many conventional techniques, e.g., control chart and logistic regression. A critical reason for such failure is the neglect of time effect in MTS—patterns associated with system faults tend to stretch a period, but a conventional control chart or classifier inspects each time stamp separately. Fault detection based on time series sequences is, therefore, essential. However, how to effectively extract features from MTS becomes a challenge. The framework proposed in this study adopts BOW models, specifically symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX), to extract features from MTS sequences, thus substantially improves the detection power against local patterns over time. Many manufacturing multisensor data are subject to such local patterns that point to the root cause of fault, so the proposed framework has a wide application in manufacturing.",

            "abstract": "Laser metal deposition (LMD) is an additive manufacturing method for metal parts by using focused thermal energy to fuse materials as they are deposited. During LMD, transient thermal signatures such as the in-situ thermal images of melt pool, contain rich information about process performance. Early prediction of such transient thermal signatures provides opportunities for process monitoring and defect prevention. While physics-based models of LMD have been conventionally used for thermal signature prediction, they have limitations and are computationally expensive for real-time prediction. A scalable, efficient data-science-based model is therefore needed. This paper develops a deep-learning-based surrogate model, called LMD-cGAN, to predict and emulate the transient thermal signatures in LMD. The model generates images for the thermal dynamics of melt pool conditionally on the deposition layer. It enables early prediction of future-layer thermal signatures for an in-process part based on its early-layer thermal signatures. To respect the physics in LMD, a physics-guided image selection (PGIS) mechanism is integrated with LMD-cGAN to calibrate the predictions against physical benchmarks of transient melt pool for the process. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated in a case study on the LMD of Ti-4Al-6V thin-walled structures. Note to Practitioners—With online sensing, many LMD applications have real-time process data that convey valuable information about the process status and part quality. The proposed method leverages these data for thermal signature prediction. LMD-cGAN is a deep-learning-based surrogate model that learns the population profile of real thermal signatures and generates thermal signatures from there. The proposed PGIS mechanism in LMD-cGAN ensures the physical validity of these predictions by benchmarking them against physical insights about the process. LMD-cGAN can be applied to predict thermal signatures in future layers based on early-layer thermal signatures of an in-process part (an implicit assumption here is that the in-process part to be predicted for is the same type). LMD-cGAN can also be applied to emulate thermal signatures in specific layers. To generate thermal signatures for generic, non-defect parts, the training data should be selected with caution – the part where the data were collected should have no obvious defects, so the thermal signatures generated by LMD-cGAN show the regular thermal dynamics. Compared with pure physical models, the proposed method incorporates process uncertainties captured from the early-layer data, hence “on-the-fly” emulation of the melt pool, while characterizing the inherent relationship between the LMD process and thermal signatures.",

Processing of the computation-intensive ML tasks can be largely enhanced by applying edge computing (EC) to traditional cloud-based schemes. System optimizations in the existing works always ignore the inference accuracy of ML models with different complexities, and their impacts on error task inference. In this article, we propose a joint task offloading and resource allocation scheme for accuracy-aware machine-learning-based IIoT applications in an edge–cloud-based network architecture. We aim at minimizing the long-term average system cost affected by the task offloading, computing resource allocation, and inference accuracy of the ML models deployed on the sensors, edge server, and cloud server. The Lyapunov optimization technique is applied to convert the long-term stochastic optimization problem into a short-term deterministic problem. An optimal algorithm based on the general Benders decomposition (GBD) technology and a heuristic algorithm based on proportional computing resource allocation and task offloading strategy comparison are proposed to efficiently solve the problem, respectively. The performance of our scheme is proved by theoretical analysis and evaluated by extensive simulations conducted in multiple scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our two algorithms in comparison with several other schemes proposed by the existing works.",

            "abstract": "Joint task inference, which fully utilizes end edge cloud cooperation, can effectively enhance the performance of deep neural network (DNN) inference services in the industrial internet of things (IIoT) applications. In this paper, we propose a novel joint resource management scheme for a multi task and multi service scenario consisting of multiple sensors, a cloud server, and a base station equipped with an edge server . A time slotted system model is proposed, incorporating DNN deployment, data size control, task offloading, computing resource allocation, and wireless channel allocation. Among them, the DNN deployment is to deploy proper DNNs on the edge server under its total resource constraint, and the data size control is to make trade off between task inference accuracy and task transmission delay through changing task da ta size. Our goal is to minimize the total cost including total task processing delay and total error inference penalty while guaranteeing long term task queue stability and all task inference accuracy requirements. Leveraging the Lyapunov optimization, we first transform the optimization problem into a deterministic problem for each time slot. Then, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed to provide the near optimal solution. We further desi gn a fast numerical method for the data size control sub problem to reduce the training complexity of the DRL model, and design a penalty mechanism to prevent frequent optimizations of DNN deployment. Extensive experiments are conducted by varying differen t crucial parameters. The superiority of our scheme is demonstrated in comparison with 3 other schemes.",

            "abstract": "Machinery fault diagnosis is crucial to ensure production safety. Deep learning has been widely investigated in intelligent fault diagnosis. However, the mechanical equipment generally runs in a complex and polytropic condition. It is challenging to perform machinery fault diagnosis under polytopic conditions. In this article, a novel multisource domain adaptation method is proposed for machinery fault diagnosis under different working conditions. First, a deep negative correlation multisource domains adaptation network (DNC-MDAN) is proposed, where the information from multisource domains is transferred into target domain based on the multisource feature alignment and adversarial learning. Second, in order to make full of the multisource domains information, an ensemble classifier corresponding to multisource domains is developed, where a DNC learning is performed in the ensemble classifier. Third, an end-to-end feature generator, discrete cosine convolutional block, is proposed in DNC-MDAN, where discrete cosine transform is embedded in the network smoothly for noise reduction. In order to validate the effectiveness of DNC-MDAN for machinery fault diagnosis, three cases are considered in this article. In comparison with other transfer learning methods, DNC-MDAN has a better fault diagnosis performance.",

            "abstract": "Vibration signals are widely utilized for machinery fault diagnosis. However, the fault-related components (i.e., impulse) in vibration signals are often buried by strong background noises due to complex working conditions. Thus, it is challenging to directly extract discriminate features from vibration signals. In this article, a novel deep neural network (DNN), multiscale weighted morphological network (MWMNet), is proposed to extract impulses from vibration signals. First, a novel morphological layer is smoothly embedded in DNN as a signal processing layer to extract impulses and filter out the noise. Second, multiple branches with different structure element (SE) scales are employed to respectively extract impulses. An adaptive weighted fusion is utilized to enhance the scales that provide strong impulsive components. Third, a morphological operator, called average-hat transform, is adopted in MWMNet, and both positive and negative impulses can be extracted from vibration signals. The effectiveness of MWMNet is validated by the experiments of gearbox fault diagnosis and bearing fault diagnosis. The experimental results show that MWMNet can learn the fault-related features and filter out noise from vibration signals well. The comparison results illustrate that MWMNet has a better fault diagnosis performance than those DNNs, e.g., one-dimensional convolutional neural network, densely connected convolutional network, and residual network.",
