Three experts independently reviewed video ( original unmodified video ) assess accuracy colour overlay relation key anatomical structures ( true positive/negative false positive/negative ) potential highlighting modify perceived risk adverse events ( needle trauma nerves , arteries , pleura , peritoneum ) block failure.RESULTS : artificial-intelligence models identified structure interest 93.5 % cases ( 1519/1624 ) , false-negative rate 3.0 % ( 48/1624 ) false-positive rate 3.5 % ( 57/1624 ) . Highlighting judged reduce risk unwanted needle trauma nerves , arteries , pleura , peritoneum 62.9-86.4 % cases ( 302/480 345/400 ) , increase risk 0.0-1.7 % ( 0/160 8/480 ) . Risk block failure reported reduced 81.3 % scans ( 585/720 ) increased 1.8 % ( 13/720 ) .CONCLUSIONS : Artificial intelligence-based devices potentially aid image acquisition interpretation ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia . studies necessary demonstrate effectiveness supporting training clinical practice.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION : NCT04906018 . 2023 Burckett-St Laurent , David Hernandez , Nadia Keane , Pearse Lobo , Clara Margetts , Steve Moka , Eleni Pawa , Amit Rosenblatt , Meg Sleep , Nick Taylor , Alasdair Woodworth , Glenn Vasalauskaite , Asta Noble , J Alison Higham , Helen","Bowness, James Simeon","Parker , C Biological clinical characteristics gene carriers far predicted onset Huntington ? disease Young Adult Study ( HD-YAS ) : cross-sectional analysis Background Disease-modifying treatments development Huntington 's disease ; crucial success identify timepoint patient 's life measurable biomarker early neurodegeneration clinical function still intact . aimed identify timepoint novel cohort young adult premanifest Huntington 's disease gene carriers ( preHD ) far predicted clinical symptom onset .

ScanNav Anatomy Peripheral Nerve Block ( Intelligent Ultrasound , Cardiff , UK ) artificial intelligence-based device produces colour overlay real-time B-mode ultrasound highlight anatomical structures interest . evaluated accuracy artificial-intelligence colour overlay perceived influence risk adverse events block failure.METHODS : Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia experts acquired 720 videos 40 volunteers ( across nine anatomical regions ) without using device . artificial-intelligence colour overlay subsequently applied . Three experts independently reviewed video ( original unmodified video ) assess accuracy colour overlay relation key anatomical structures ( true positive/negative false positive/negative ) potential highlighting modify perceived risk adverse events ( needle trauma nerves , arteries , pleura , peritoneum ) block failure.RESULTS : artificial-intelligence models identified structure interest 93.5 % cases ( 1519/1624 ) , false-negative rate 3.0 % ( 48/1624 ) false-positive rate 3.5 % ( 57/1624 ) .

Methods Huntington 's disease Young Adult Study ( HD-YAS ) UK . recruited young adults preHD controls matched age , education , sex ensure group least 60 participants imaging data , accounting scan fails . Controls either family history Huntington 's disease negative genetic test , known family history Huntington 's disease . participants underwent detailed neuropsychiatric cognitive assessments , including tests Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery battery assessing emotion , motivation , impulsivity social cognition ( EMOTICOM ) . Imaging ( done participants without contraindications ) included volumetric MRI , diffusion imaging , multiparametric mapping . Biofluid markers neuronal health examined using blood CSF collection . cross-sectional analysis using general least-squares linear models assess group differences associations age CAG length , relating predicted years clinical onset . Results corrected multiple comparisons using false discovery rate ( FDR ) , FDR < 0.05 deemed significant result . Findings Data obtained Aug 2 , 2017 , April 25 , 2019 . recruited 64 young adults preHD 67 controls . Mean ages participants 29.0 years ( SD 5.6 ) 29.1 years ( 5.7 ) preHD control groups , respectively . noted significant evidence cognitive psychiatric impairment preHD participants 23.6 years ( SD 5.8 ) predicted onset ( FDR 0.22-0.87 cognitive measures , 0.31-0.91 neuropsychiatric measures ) . preHD cohort slightly smaller putamen volumes ( FDR=0.03 ) , appear closely related predicted years onset ( FDR=0.54 ) . group differences brain imaging measures ( FDR > 0.16 ) . CSF neurofilament light protein ( NfL ) , plasma NfL , CSF YKL-40 elevated far-from-onset preHD cohort compared controls ( FDR < 0.0001 , =0.01 , =0.03 , respectively ) . CSF NfL elevations likely individuals closer expected clinical onset ( FDR < 0.0001 ) . Interpretation report normal brain function yet rise sensitive measures neurodegeneration preHD cohort approximately 24 years predicted clinical onset . CSF NfL appears sensitive measure plasma NfL monitor disease progression . preHD cohort one earliest yet studied , findings could used inform decisions initiate potential future intervention delay prevent neurodegeneration function intact . 2020.0 Scahill , RI Zeun , P Osborne-Crowley , K Johnson , EB Gregory , Lowe , J Nair , O'Callaghan , C Langley , C Papoutsi , McColgan , P Estevez-Fraga , C Fayer , K Wellington , H Rodrigues , FB Byrne , LM Heselgrave , Hyare , H Sampaio , C Zetterberg , H Zhang , H Wild , EJ Rees , G Robbins , TW Sahakian , BJ Langbehn , Tabrizi , SJ","Parker, C","Z.
